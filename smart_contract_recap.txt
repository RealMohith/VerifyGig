🎯 Goal:
Build a blockchain-based skill verification system, where:

Workers request skill verification (e.g., “Advanced JavaScript”)

Interviewers test & approve skills

The skill is stored immutably on blockchain

Employers can verify it by scanning the resume

| Step  | Description                                                                         |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1** | **Initialized a Hardhat project** for smart contract development                    |
| **2** | Created a smart contract `SkillVerifier.sol` to store skill verifications           |
| **3** | Wrote deployment logic (`deploy.js`) to push contract to blockchain                 |
| **4** | Set up **Ganache** (local Ethereum blockchain with 10 fake accounts, 1000 ETH each) |
| **5** | Deployed contract to local blockchain using **Hardhat + Ganache**                   |
| **6** | Set up **MetaMask** with Ganache wallet + connected to local blockchain             |
| ✅     | Your wallet is now synced with your contract and blockchain                         |


🎉 You now have:
Your own private blockchain (Ganache)

Your own deployed smart contract (SkillVerifier)

Your dev wallet connected to the blockchain (MetaMask)

All fake ETH and test accounts available

Next up: frontend to use this!
